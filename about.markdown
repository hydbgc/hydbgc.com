Thereâ€™s more to board gaming than the childhood memories of Monopoly, Snakes and Ladders, Uno and Pictionary.

We place workers, draft cards, control areas, hide roles, bid in auctions, and score an array of victory points.

We are passionate.
We are competitive.
We are fun!

We are the Hyderabad board gamers, and we invite board game enthusiasts to join us.

Playing for the first time? No worries! We brief all newbies about our tables before we begin.
Cheers!

In Fond Memory Of Sid ðŸ’œ
